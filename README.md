## ðŸ“˜ Introduction

Economic growth is typically measured by a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). A rising GDP often attracts multinational firms to invest, which in turn contributes further to economic expansionâ€”creating a positive feedback loop that propels sustained growth. The performance and investment behavior of these companies can be reflected in their stock market trends, making stock performance a potential indicator of broader economic conditions.

This project aims to investigate whether a meaningful correlation exists between a country's GDP trends and the stock price movements of companies operating or investing in that country. Establishing such a link could provide valuable predictive insights for both governments and corporations, enabling more informed decision-making regarding investment strategies, policy planning, and economic forecasting.
