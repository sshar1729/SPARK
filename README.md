## ðŸ“˜ Introduction
Economic growth of a country is typically measured by its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, which provides insight into the average economic well-being of a countryâ€™s citizens. A rising GDP per capita signals improving economic conditions, attracting multinational firms seeking profitable investment opportunities. Such investments further contribute to economic expansion, creating a positive cycle that drives sustained growth. 

GDP per capita is influenced by various economic and socio-economic factors, including Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), Gross Capital Formation, and even less intuitive indicators like mobile cellular subscribers and life expectancy.

Among these, corporate investment plays an important role. Since the performance and investment behavior of these companies are often influenced by the broader economic environment, stock market activity can serve as a reflection of their economic sentiment and trend. As a result, stock performance has the potential to be an indicator of a countryâ€™s overall economic conditions.

We investige the data of G-20 countries. As a baseline model we consider the dependence of GDP on different factors , without the stock market indicators and studied its performance. We notice that adding the stock market indicator potentially enhances the model performance by increasing the cross-validation mean R^2 from 0.44 to 0.79. 

In future, we would like to extend the work to a broader range of countries. While the modelling is done with a Random Forest Regressor we would also like to impliment the advanced modelling technique like ARIMA to see the temporal dependence in the data.
